# Automated-Greenhouse-with-AI-for-Disease-Detection

The **Automated Greenhouse with AI for Disease Detection** is a smart, AI-powered system designed to enhance agricultural efficiency through real-time environmental monitoring, automation, and AI-driven plant disease detection. The project integrates **ESP32 microcontrollers** to regulate climate conditions, manage sensors, and control actuators, while an **ESP32-CAM module**, linked to an **InceptionV3 CNN model**, enables real-time classification of plant diseases for early intervention. A **web-based interface** allows users to remotely monitor conditions, adjust settings, and manage devices, ensuring accessibility and ease of use. With a strong focus on **sustainability**, the system optimizes resource usage by efficiently managing water, light, and climate control, reducing waste while improving crop yield. This innovative approach minimizes manual labor, enhances productivity, and offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for modern agriculture.
